mysql module for Qore
version 1.0 by David Nichols

Requires qore 0.7.0 and mysql 3.3 or newer headers and libraries to build

With MySQL 4.1+ you can get transaction support and the module will use the more efficient prepared statement interface.

The driver supports the following features (depending on the MySQL client library version):
* is thread-safe
* stored procedure execution with binding and retrieving values (5 and newer)
* transaction management is supported (4.1 and newer)
* transparent character encoding conversion is supported if necessary

The driver's name is "mysql" and the Datasource type constant is SQL::DSMySQL
ex: $db = new Datasource(DSMySQL);
ex: $db = new Datasource("mysql");

The mysql module is stable and has been extensively tested.

BUILD AND INSTALL
-----------------

If your mysql installation is in a non-standard location, set the MYSQL_DIR environment variable to the location of the installation before running configure.
Note that you have to use g++ 4.0.* on Darwin to link with newer versions of the MySQL libraries

configure
make
sudo make install

The configure script will find out where your qore module directory is found and set this for the install directory.

BUILD FROM SVN
--------------

reconf.sh
configure
make
sudo make install
